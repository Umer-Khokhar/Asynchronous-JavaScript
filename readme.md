# Asynchronous JavaScript Concepts

This repository contains examples and explanations of asynchronous JavaScript concepts, focusing on callbacks, promises, and async/await. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and scalable JavaScript code.

## Callbacks

Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked when a certain event or operation is complete.

In this section, you will find examples and explanations of using callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks. The examples cover scenarios such as handling asynchronous requests, event handling, and more.

## Promises

Promises provide a more structured way of handling asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to attach callbacks to handle the results.

In this section, you will explore the usage of promises, including creating and consuming promises, chaining multiple asynchronous operations, error handling, and using built-in promise methods.

## Async/Await

Async/await is a modern syntax introduced in ECMAScript 2017 that provides a cleaner and more readable way of writing asynchronous code. It is built on top of promises and allows you to write asynchronous operations in a synchronous manner.

This section focuses on the usage of async/await, including writing async functions, handling promises with await, error handling, and combining async/await with other asynchronous concepts.
